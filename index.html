        <p class="grid-item">My name is is Zonia Ramirez. I have been a dental assistant for 14 years. After all those years of assistatnt, I decided I wanted to explore a different career. That's how I ended up in a full stack web developer bootcamp. My past professional career taught me a ot of skills that will help me in my new profession. I have learned to work in a fast-paced environment, to be part of a group, to work individually without guidance, learned to multitask, taught me communication skills, problem-solving skills, and has gave me the oportunity to interact in a frindley and respectful way with a diverse group of people.</p>
